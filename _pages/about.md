I am a 3rd year PhD candidate at [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/), Institut Polytechnique de Paris, in the group [S2A](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/ssa/) (Signal, Statistics and Learning) of LTCI. I conduct my PhD under the supervision of [François Portier](https://sites.google.com/site/fportierwebpage/) and [Pascal Bianchi](https://bianchi.wp.imt.fr/). 
  
I am working on adaptive Monte Carlo methods and stochastic approximation with applications to Reinforcement Learning. My research topics focus on probability theory, optimization and machine learning applications.
 
I graduated from Télécom Paris in 2019. I hold a master’s degree in applied mathematics from Télécom Paris and a master’s degree in Mathematics, Vision and Learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay.
