**About me**

I am a Quantitative Researcher at [Qube Research and Technologies (QRT)](https://www.qube-rt.com/) working on quantitative strategies for portfolio optimization. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Applied Mathematics (CMAP)](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en/groups/statistique-apprentissage-simulation-image) at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) working with [Aymeric Dieuleveut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/) on Federated Learning and (stochastic) optimization problems. I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en/search?s=en%20home%20en) at [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) in the team [S2A](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/ssa/) (Signal, Statistics and Learning) of LTCI. 

I conducted my PhD under the supervision of [François Portier](https://sites.google.com/site/fportierwebpage/) and [Pascal Bianchi](https://bianchi.wp.imt.fr/). You can find the manuscript on [theses.fr](https://www.theses.fr/2023IPPAT007) and the slides of the defense [here](https://remileluc.github.io/assets/slides_defense.pdf). Before that, I graduated from Télécom Paris in 2019. I hold a master’s degree in applied mathematics from Télécom Paris and a master’s degree in Mathematics, Vision and Learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay. 

For more details, please see my [CV](https://remileluc.github.io/assets/resume.pdf).

**My Research**

My research topics/interests focus on: 
- Monte Carlo methods
- Stochastic Optimization
- Reinforcement Learning
- Federated Learning

More generally, I am interested in applications of machine learning to real-world problems such as building intelligent systems that enable collaborative learning. I am always looking for collaborations and would love to hear from you! Reach out if any of my work sounds interesting.
