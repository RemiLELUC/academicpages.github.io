The convergence modes for random sequences will be reviewed and further developed. Convergence in law will be particularly studied. Applications in asymptotic statistics will be discussed. The theory of discrete-time martingales is an essential tool for stochastic calculus. This theory will be introduced with applications to Markov chains.
